          {'"'}Banadoro üçå{'"'} app uses a popular studying method called {'"'}
          pomodoro{'"'}. Firstly it was used to schedule study session time for
          25 minutes and break for 5 (but you can adjust this time to your
          needs). Then you repeat this process.
          <br />
          <br />
          After longer time of work, our focus becomes weaker so we need to take
          a break.
