# Tutorial

After visiting the website you may see a timer which is used in popular studying method called "pomodoro". The idea of that method is that you set a schedule to study for some time and do regular breaks. It is all made to keep you focused during the session.  
Second thing you may see is form used to add tasks. After you add them, you can mark them as checked of totally delete them. These tasks are stored in local storage so you don't lose any data after refreshing.
If you scroll down you may see quick tutorial.  
In the top bar you can see three tabs, first is ranking where you can see top 10 users with the most time spent studying with the app.  
Next you have account tab where you can create an account or login with Google. When you are logged, tasks you create are no longer stored just locally but also on the server so you can have access to them from any device.  
In the settings tab you have some options like changing duration of session and break, auto start option or switching between light and dark mode.
